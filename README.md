Learning programming is like learning to do parkour, you are not going
to learn how to do parkour by reading a book, you have to stamp yourself
on the floor.

## [Challenges](./challenges.md)

## Have in mind

1. Understand the problem
  * Do your own research, it's an incredibly useful skill which can be
    applied to and can be applied to anything.
2. Implementation
  * Take the language you're most familiar with to start your project.
    If the problem is way too easy, pick a language you've never used.
3. Test
  * Write test cases for your program. Get used to thinking about how
    you can break your software.
4. Re-Implement
  * Now that you have something together with lots of documentation and
    experience, try a different language and try to match it as closely
    as possible.
5. Don't stop learning
  * Now that you've gotten this far, don't stop trying to challenge
    yourself. Keep a portfolio and keep adding to it.
6. Resources:
  * Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, Google.
7. Literature
  * Knuth: The Art of Computer Programming
  * Sierna: The Algorithm Design Manual
  * Carmen et al: Introduction to Algorithms
  * Russel: Artificial Intellingece: A Modern Approach
